== HALP

Our week 6 project was to expand a skeletal project used for making homework help requests.  It was fully test-driven and involved setting up a mailer for registration verification and notifications, as well as our first deployment on Heroku.

My first project working with a partner, and it was a blast; so much fun getting things done twice as fast (or more).  We did a lot of planning out the structure on paper and moving post-its around as it evolved.
